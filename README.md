# Weather App

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It's goal
was to create a site where you can check the weather for the next 5 days. 
I used Open Weather Map Api
to fetch the forecast.



## Get started
Clone the repo with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/justyna13/Weather-App.git
```

## Running the project

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:


```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.


Note that you have to set your own x-rapidapi-key to get data from API. You can enter the key in Forecast component.
